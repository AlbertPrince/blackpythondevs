Your voice matters, and your willingness to speak up ensures that everyone feels valued and heard. By reporting any instances of misconduct, you're not only advocating for yourself but also for the well-being of your community. Together, we can create environments where everyone feels empowered to thrive. So, don't hesitateâ€”your actions today pave the way for a brighter, more equitable tomorrow.

## Reporting an Incident

We must emphasize you should file a report if you believe that the Code of Conduct may have been violated, even if you are unsure or were not directly involved in the incident. 

Your report will be recorded and initially shared with our Code of Conduct team and our Code of Conduct Liaison. If a consensus cannot be met, the Executor and Vice-Executor will also be notified.

If determined that corrective or remediative action is necessary, we will notify the person in which the report was directed towards while keeping the identity of the reporting person anonymous if possible.

## Goals of Incident Response

The Code of Conduct working group is expected to acknowledge the report in a timely manner and reach out to the reporting party indicating that the event has been documented and the working group is working to determine the appropriate course of action.

The working group should discussed in the #code-of-conduct-working-group text and voice channels  of the Black Python Devs Discord channel. It is important that these conversations stay in these channels to keep the anonymity of the user. 

In the event that a member of the Code of Conduct working group is involved in the reported incident, they should recuse themselves from the discussion. If said member is the offending member, the Executor or Vice-Executor will act in place of the offending member.

### Things to remember when handling an incident

- Blending of Cultures are difficult but showing respect, compassion, and empathy is not. Our judgement is based on the intent of the action
- Act in fairness to all parties, retaining the anonymity of the reporting person. 
- Failure to adjust to corrective or remediate actions will not be tolerated and will result in more severe action.

## Taking Action

If the Code of Conduct working group has decided that some action should be taken, it will be in the form of corrective or remediate action.

### Corrective Action

Corrective action is deemed necessary if it is determined that a Code of Conduct violation has indeed happened.

#### Types of Corrective Action

- A verbal and recorded warning
- Permanent suspension from our community channels.
- Removal of a leadership position

### Remediate Actions

Remediate action is a non-disciplinary action that works to clarify the Code of Conduct or a members behavior that while not considered a violation, could be misconstrued as innappropriate.

Remediate action is taken in the event that some cultural or communicative misunderstanding has taken place and it is determined that something could be done to clarify things.

#### Types of Remediate Action

- A corrective conversation
- Necessary policy update and addition to our Code of Conduct
